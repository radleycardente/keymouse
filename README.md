# Keymouse

>A keyboard controller for mouse input

Designed to allow hands to be on the keyboards, rather than switching to the mouse. 

## Requirements

Dependencies include robotgo, which requires the compiler GCC.

## Future Enhancements

- Clicking
- Adjustable speeds
- Moving diagonally
- Running as a program instead of just a go script
- Setting up own keybindings, for keyboards that do not have arrow keys.
